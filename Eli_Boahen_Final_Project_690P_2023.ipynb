I was truly blessed to have learned about HTML at about 11 years old, and am honored that I have had the opportunity to spark student interest over the past 7 or so years. I have seen how even the surface level concepts of computational thinking can really change a student's mindset on life. Expanding into the Social Sciences, technoliteracy can determine so much of one's life. Algorithms have been used to determine the social welfare from screening \"scammers\" to policing, phishing scams often target those in need or with lower than societally expected technoliteracy.\n",

        "\n",
        "### `Q2` Analysis\n",
        "Most frequently, participants had just 1 source where they learn about AI, with 2 and 3 sources behind that. Even with the ability to select multiple options, the `Internet` and `Social Media` were the most popular sources while `Discussions` were the least popular source of AI knowledge.\n",
        "\n",
        "### `Q5` Analysis\n",
        "Overall, participants were curious about AI that anything else. `Curiosity` had a significantly higher selection rate, breaking 60, while the other options were below 20. Amongst the other options however, `Fear` was higher than `Trust` but more participants felt `Indifference` towards AI rather than `Trust`.\n",
        "\n",
        "### `Q7` & `Q14` Analysis\n",
        "This was a great example of how, even with the same data, looking at a spreadsheet is wildly different from looking at a visualization. I did not realize how economics focused the majors were until I plotted the data. Of the 3 majors represented in the data, `Statistics and Economic Forecasting` had a range of 3 to 10, while `Economic Cybernetic` and `Economic Informatics` majors ranged from 2 to 10. Despite this fact, `Statistics and Economic Forecasting` and `Economic Informatics` had the same median.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Re-visiting My Questions**\n",
        "1.   What are students' sentiments towards AI?\n",
        "2.   What are students' sentiments towards AI in education?\n",
        "\n",
        "Students are curious about AI; they are significantly more curious than fearful. Most believe AI will be useful in the educational process, though forecasting majors seem to be more optimistic.\n",
        "\n",
        "These sentiments towards AI may be influenced by their sources of AI education. Most participants ascertained their knowledge through the `Internet` and `Social Media` which have a range of opinions on AI, versus discussion and papers which tend to look at AI with an academic critical lens.\n"

        "# Conclusion 📁\n",
        "AI is a big topic, but its popularity at the moment may also be its downfall. Adoption without education seems improbably—how can someone be onboarded to a tool without knowing it—and yet it is happening across industry with AI. Through looking at sentiments, we can gain a grasp on the true reality of a technology post presentation, reveal, or launch party.\n",

        "The Code Graveyard is a holding post for the ghosts of code's past (i.e. all the code that failed or I ultimately couldn't use). This is something I've done across assignments. I think it's not only helpful, but important to look at the failures along the way that got us to our final successes.\n",
        "\n",
        "In my own tech journey, I have had a lot of challenges coding. That is one of the many reasons why technoliteracy means so much to me. Throughout this final project, I looked back at old code, notes from office hours, and remembered *how* to ask questions when I looked things up. In a weird twist, there isn't that much in my final graveyard. I believe that's due to my previous graveyards. In an unexpected moment of reflection during this project, I feel a bit proud of the obsticles overcome in my own technology education. I hope I get to do this more, and make more graveyards.\n",
